# supaapigo

`supaapigo` is a simple Go package that wraps Supabase's authentication and storage functionalities using the `auth-go` and `storage-go` libraries. It provides an easy-to-use interface to interact with Supabase's authentication and storage APIs.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Integrate Supabase's authentication features into your Go projects.
- **Storage**: Easily interact with Supabase storage for file uploads, downloads, and management.

## Installation

To use `supaapigo` in your Go projects, you can install it with:

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/supaapigo
```

Make sure to replace `yourusername` with the actual username or organization where your repository is hosted.

## Usage

### Initialize the Usecase

To use the package across your projects, start by initializing the `SupaapiUsecase`. You'll need your Supabase project reference, storage URL, and API key to authenticate.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/yourusername/supaapigo"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize the SupaapiUsecase
	projectReference := "your-supabase-project-reference"
	storageURL := "https://your-supabase-storage-url"
	apiKey := "your-supabase-api-key"

	supaapi := supaapigo.NewSupaapiUsecase(projectReference, storageURL, apiKey)

	// Use supaapi for authentication and storage operations
	// Example: Uploading files, managing authentication, etc.
}
```

### Example: Authentication

The `SupaapiUsecase` uses the `auth-go` package to handle authentication-related operations. You can access the `authClient` from the usecase to sign up users, sign in, and manage sessions.

Example for signing up a user:

```go
import "github.com/supabase-community/auth-go"

func SignUpUser(supaapi supaapigo.SupaapiUsecaseInterface, email, password string) error {
    user, err := supaapi.AuthClient.SignUp(auth.SignUpUserInput{
        Email:    email,
        Password: password,
    })
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Printf("User created: %v\n", user)
    return nil
}
```

### Example: Storage

The `SupaapiUsecase` also integrates the `storage-go` package, allowing you to easily manage files in Supabase Storage.

Example for uploading a file:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func UploadFile(supaapi supaapigo.SupaapiUsecaseInterface, bucketName, filePath string) error {
    file, err := os.Open(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer file.Close()

    res, err := supaapi.StorageClient.UploadFile(bucketName, filePath, file)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Printf("File uploaded: %v\n", res)
    return nil
}
```

### Interfaces for Flexibility

By using the `SupaapiUsecaseInterface`, you can easily mock this interface and write unit tests for your project without depending directly on Supabaseâ€™s services.

## Project Structure

- **authClient**: A reference to the Supabase authentication client, which allows you to perform user-related operations such as sign-ups, logins, etc.
- **storageClient**: A reference to the Supabase storage client, used to upload, download, and manage files in the Supabase storage.
